# OpenGL Transformation and Texture

[![Hits](https://hits.sh/github.com/vmsaif/opengl-transformation-and-texture.svg?label=Visits&color=100b75)](https://hits.sh/github.com/vmsaif/opengl-transformation-and-texture/)

This project demonstrates the power of OpenGL's transformation capabilities by rendering eight houses with distinct transformations. Each house is crafted with a triangular roof and a floor, and the entire scene is complemented by a textured background.

## Features

- **Eight Houses**: Each uniquely transformed using translation, scaling, and rotation.
- **Display Lists**: Efficiently renders the houses using OpenGL's display list feature.
- **Background Texture**: A rich texture sourced from a BMP format image, enhancing the visual appeal of the scene.
